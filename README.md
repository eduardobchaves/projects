Eduardo Chaves - Personal Projects

Description:
This GitHub repository contains a collection of personal Python projects that I've worked on. 
These projects cover a range of topics and demonstrate my coding skills and interests. Each project is self-contained and can be used, modified, or extended for various purposes. 

Projects Included:

[Analysis of Long-Term vs Short-Term Correlation Variation as an Investment Strategy:](https://github.com/eduardobchaves/projects/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Long-Term%20vs%20Short-Term%20Correlation%20Variation%20as%20an%20Investment%20Strategy.ipynb)) The objective of this analysis is to identify if the long-term correlation between macroeconomic variables and highly visible stocks (such as DJIA listed) can be compared with the short-term correlation of the same variables, looking for gaps in the correlation trend that can be an indication of an investment opportunity.
Inequality in New Zealand and its Impacts on Socioeconomics Factors: The objective is to understand the inequality scenario in New Zealand and find potential valid correlations so that socioeconomic factors in various fields can be improved with the reduction of inequality in the country.
